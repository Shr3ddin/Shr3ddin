<h3>🐱‍👤 ABOUT</h3>

<p>Welcome to my little programming world! My name is Patrick, and my passion for IT began years ago when I started writing simple scripts for games, just for fun (and to earn my very first bit of cash 😄). Now, I’m focused on improving my skills in frontend technologies and software testing.</p>
